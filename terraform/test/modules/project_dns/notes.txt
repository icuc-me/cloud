This module ONLY establishes the Public DNS tree structure, it does not
add any records except for nameserver glue between zones.

For test and stage environments:

    - Creates, manages and glues testing subdomain ${ENV_NAME}_${ENV_UUID} onto ${FQDN}
      (e.g. test_1234abcd.test.cloud.example.com)
    - Creates and manages entire DNS tree, including legacy domains under the
      testing subdomain.  (e.g. foo.bar.test_1234abcd.test.cloud.example.com)
    - Manages glue records for the above, so all names/records are reachable.

For prod environment:

    - Manage "cloud" and "site" subdomains (e.g. cloud.example.com)
    - Manage legacy domains & records (e.g. foo.bar.baz)
    - Manage "test" and "stage" zones in their respective projects
      (e.g. test.cloud.example.com and stage.cloud.example.com)
    - Manages glue records for "test" and "stage" zones in prod. project
      (e.g. zone for cloud.example.com)
    - Manages "prod" zone in prod. project
